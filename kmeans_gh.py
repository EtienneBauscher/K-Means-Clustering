'''This program implements the basic K-means algorithm and returns the following:
1 - A printout of the initial data as read from the csv file.
2 - A randomly selected set of centroids printout based on the "k" input received from the user.
3 - A print out of the newly rewritten centroids after each iteration based on
    the mean calculation of the cluster data points.
4 - A sum of the counts of countries per cluster upon each iteration.
5 - A list of countries per cluster upon each iteration.
6 - Birth Rate and Life Expectancy Averages per cluster upon each iterations.
7 - A plot of each iteration's cluster configuration.'''
